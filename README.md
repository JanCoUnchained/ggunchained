# ggunchained

This is an extension for ggplot2 in a very early stage of development - almost nothing works yet.
The inital goal is to find out, whether a package like this could be useful for us.

### What it does
###### Minimal ggplot2 themes
theme_janco_point(), theme_janco_bar()

###### Split violin function 
geom_split_violin()

### How to install
```r
library(devtools)
install_github("JanCoUnchained/ggunchained")
```
